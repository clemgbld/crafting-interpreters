Earlier, I said that the |, *, and + forms we added to our grammar metasyntax were just syntactic sugar. Take this grammar:

expr â†’ expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
| IDENTIFIER
| NUMBER

Produce a grammar that matches the same language but does not use any of that notational sugar.

Bonus: What kind of expression does this bit of grammar encode?

--

expr -> expr subexpr
expr -> IDENTIFIER
expr -> NUMBER

subexpr -> x x
subexpr -> z z
subexpr -> x z
subexpr -> z x
subexpr -> subexpr x
subexpr -> subexpr z

x -> "()" 
x -> "(" expr")"
x -> "(" expr y ")"


y-> "," expr
y -> "," expr y

z -> "." IDENTIFIER

Bonus: this expression seems to encode a parser that generate an AST

The Visitor pattern lets you emulate the functional style in an object-oriented language. Devise a complementary pattern for a functional language. It should let you bundle all of the operations on one type together and let you define new types easily.

(SML or Haskell would be ideal for this exercise, but Scheme or another Lisp works as well.)

I choose scheme to do that task since i already completed SICP i'm pretty familiar with the language.
